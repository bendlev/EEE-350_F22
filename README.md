Random Signal Analysis introduces the concepts of probability and random signals with application to problems in engineering. As many of the students in the class are interested in careers in aerospace, the module focuses on airline data and appications to decision making in the airline industry.  In the first part of the module, students engage in exploratory data analysis using univariate and bivariate analyses to generate hypotheses about factors that contribute to flight delays.  In the second part, students assume the role of a consultant employed by Phoenix Sky Harbor airport to investigate the role of delays in the performance of airlines. At the end of Part 2, students make an informed recommendation for Sky Harbor based on the output of various machine learning models they implement.  The module uses MATLAB as a platform and covers the data science topics of analyzing data, visualizing data, drawing conclusions, and communicating data.

For instructors and interested parties, the history of this repository (with detailed commits), can be found [here](https://github.com/difuse-dartmouth/EEE-350_F22/commits/main/).

**On Repository Structure:**
* **Preliminary**: Contains all files pre-requisite to module development. ```difuse_scaffolding``` is provided by DIFUSE, and ```course_materials``` (including course syllabus, relevant assignments, etc.) are provided by course instructor.
* **Development**: Contains all files that developers deem necessary to be stored on GitHub. Given the uniqueness of each module and the abstraction that DIFUSE provides, the development team is allowed to use the platform they prefer (or as discussed with instructor)
* **Completed_Module**: DIFUSE is committed to increasing data science education, and shares its work publicly as an NSF-funded grant. In order for these modules to remain usable by course instructors, DIFUSE removes the solutions to module assignments in its public release. Thus, the public repository will have the ```solutions\``` folder removed.
* **Additional**: At the discretion of module developers, contains sample datasets and other materials. May include on-ramp tutorials for module platforms (e.g. MATLAB Onramp), or anecdotes of challenges in implementation (e.g. data sources that were inaccessible or difficult to acquire).
