Random Signal Analysis introduces the concepts of probability and random signals with application to problems in engineering. As many of the students in the class are interested in careers in aerospace, the module focuses on airline data and appications to decision making in the airline industry.  In the first part of the module, students engage in exploratory data analysis using univariate and bivariate analyses to generate hypotheses about factors that contribute to flight delays.  In the second part, students assume the role of a consultant employed by Phoenix Sky Harbor airport to investigate the role of delays in the performance of airlines. At the end of Part 2, students make an informed recommendation for Sky Harbor based on the output of various machine learning models they implement.  The module uses MATLAB as a platform and covers the data science topics of analyzing data, visualizing data, drawing conclusions, and communicating data.
