This folder contains all the components of the data science module for ASU's EEE 350: Introduction to Scientific Computing.

## Primary Objective

This module’s aim is to reinforce the statistical concepts introduced in class through the process of building a data analysis pipeline. Statistical concepts are first implemented to gain an understanding of the data, and this understanding is then used to implement machine learning models. The module is split into two assignments: the first part has students work with the dataset to gain insight into its variables and underlying relationships (exploratory data analysis), and the second part has students implement supervised machine learning models to generate predictions that may inform the decision making of airlines. The machine learning assignment provides additional introductions to the underlying concepts and focuses on interpreting the results rather than coding the models by providing function wrappers to expedite the process.

## Student Expectations

This module was designed for the cohort of students enrolled in Dr. Wang’s class, therefore assuming some working knowledge of MATLAB coding. The module also assumes students have covered some basic probability (e.g., normal distributions) and statistical (e.g., hypothesis testing) concepts in their class.

## Learning Objectives 
By completing the module, you will:
1. Understand the steps of exploratory data analysis and what conclusions can be drawn about the relationships in the data.
2. Understand the difference between regression and classification and the conclusions that can be drawn from each.
3. Create and interpret data visualizations to evaluate models and answer questions.
4. Gain comfort applying the aforementioned concepts to a real-world dataset and interpreting and presenting the results in an informative manner.


## Module Outline
The "public/components" folder will serve as the primary folder for distributing materials to students. Inside you'll find materials for Part 1 and Part 2, and their respective Solutions, in similarly named folders. The Canvas quiz (to be completed in tandem with Part 1) is in the Module Components folder, and can be uploaded to Canvas directly (as a .zip file). Module Data houses the principal dataset for the module, **airline\_delay\_analysis.csv**.

| **File Name** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| **DIFUSE\_Stats\_Module\_Part\_1\_Assignment.pdf** | Includes an introduction to the learning objectives for the module; a description of the dataset and a codebook for the dataset; a briefing to prepare students to answer questions in **DIFUSE\_Stats\_Module\_Part\_1.mlx.** |
| **DIFUSE\_Stats\_Module\_Part\_1.mlx** | 10 questions that ask students to perform exploratory analysis on the provided dataset; provides justification for different types of analysis (measures of center, measures of spread); used to complete the Canvas quiz. |
| **DIFUSE\_Stats\_Module\_Part\_2\_Assignment.pdf** | Includes an introduction to the "case" for Part 2, students are hired as consultants to recommend a course of action to Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport; includes rubric for presentation and resource links. |
| **DIFUSE\_Stats\_Module\_Part\_2.mlx** | Asks students to perform exploratory analysis for 2 airlines of their choosing; guides students through the use of supervised ML models in MATLAB; used to produce the graphs and visualizations that will populate their final presentation. |
| **DIFUSE\_Stats\_Module\_Part\_1\_Solution.mlx** | Solutions to Part 1 of the module, including sample function calls and visualizations. |
| **SamplePresentation.pdf** | Solution to Part 2 of the module, a sample presentation that provides an idea of what the final product may look like. (in PDF and .pptx format for ease of use) |
| **Canvas Quiz** | For students to complete alongside Part 1 of the Module |


## Implementation Calendar

Use this section to get an idea of the timeline of the module, what components are involved, and what documents are related to each component. This is the schedule intended for module deployment by the DIFUSE team, though instructors are welcome to modify the timeline to fit their course environment.
